## Story Prompt Ideas for Loulia

### Primary Story Concept
**Theme**: A mystery land made of puzzles and riddles  
**Setting**: Enchanted magical world with secret passages (Harry Potter inspired)  
**Magic Item**: A magical yellow device (Nintendo Switch-inspired) that helps solve puzzles  
**Core Message**: The power of friendship and family, especially protective bonds with sisters

### Suggested Story Prompts

#### Option 1: The Puzzle Palace Mystery
"Loulia discovers a mysterious yellow crystal that transforms into a magical device, leading her and her sisters Sara and Aya into an enchanted palace filled with riddles. Each room holds a different puzzle that can only be solved when the three sisters combine their unique strengths - Loulia's bravery and curiosity, Sara's wisdom and grace, and Aya's creativity and problem-solving skills."

#### Option 2: The Secret Library Adventure
"While reading her favorite book, Loulia finds a hidden message that reveals the existence of a secret magical library where books come alive. Armed with a magical yellow compass that responds to her Nintendo Switch skills, she must navigate through rooms of living fairy tales with her sisters to help restore missing stories to the world."

#### Option 3: The Sisters' Bond Quest
"When Sara and Aya mysteriously disappear into a world of enchanted puzzles, brave Loulia must use her bookworm knowledge and a magical yellow key (that works like her beloved Nintendo Switch) to solve increasingly complex riddles. Each puzzle she solves reveals more about the unbreakable bond between sisters and brings her closer to rescuing them."

### Story Generation Settings
