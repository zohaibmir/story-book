# AI Model Upgrade Plan - Character Consistency with Image References

## Current Issue
Our system uploads and displays character images but **doesn't actually use them** for AI generation. DALL-E 3 only accepts text prompts, not image references.

## Solution: Latest AI Models (2025)

### 1. GPT-image-1 (April 2025) - Primary Solution
**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Accepts images as input (breakthrough feature)
- ✅ Image editing and inpainting
- ✅ Better instruction following than DALL-E 3
- ✅ Reliably renders text in images
- ✅ True character consistency with reference photos

**Access:** Limited preview - Apply here: https://aka.ms/oai/gptimage1access

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment>/images/generations?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
```

**Sample Request with Image Input:**
```json
{
    "prompt": "Generate Loulia in a magical library scene, maintaining the same character appearance",
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "image": "<base64_encoded_character_photo>",
    "size": "1024x1024",
    "quality": "high",
    "input_fidelity": "high"
}
```

### 2. GPT-4 Vision - Character Analysis
**Use Cases:**
- Analyze uploaded character photos
- Extract detailed character descriptions
- Create consistent prompts across models

### 3. Hybrid Approach Architecture
```
Character Photo Upload
    ↓
GPT-4 Vision Analysis (extract features)
    ↓
Primary: GPT-image-1 (with image reference)
    ↓ (if unavailable)
Fallback: DALL-E 3 (with enhanced text description)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Access and Setup
1. Apply for GPT-image-1 limited access
2. Set up Azure blob storage for public image URLs
3. Configure new API endpoints

### Phase 2: Service Enhancement
1. Upgrade ImageGenerationService with GPT-image-1 support
2. Add image upload to Azure storage
3. Implement GPT-4 Vision character analysis

### Phase 3: API Integration
1. Update routes to support image inputs
2. Add error handling for model availability
3. Implement fallback logic

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Test with real character photos
2. Verify consistency across multiple illustrations
3. Performance and quality validation

## Expected Results
- **True Character Consistency:** Same face, features, and appearance across all story illustrations
- **Better Quality:** GPT-image-1 superior to DALL-E 3
- **Reliability:** Fallback system ensures service availability
- **User Satisfaction:** Finally delivers on the promise of using their character photos

## Technical Considerations
- GPT-image-1 requires publicly accessible image URLs (not localhost)
- Image files must be <50MB, PNG/JPG format
- API rate limits and costs may be different
- Limited access availability timeline

## Cost Implications
- GPT-image-1: New pricing structure (TBD)
- GPT-4 Vision: Analysis costs for character photos
- Azure Storage: Minimal blob storage costs
- Overall: Higher quality justifies increased costs
